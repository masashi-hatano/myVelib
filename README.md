# myVelib

## Overview
A bike sharing system (like, for example, Velib in Paris) allows inhabitants to rent bicycles 
and cycle around a metropolitan area. Such a system consists of several interacting parts
including: the renting stations (displaced in key points of a metropolitan area), different
kind of bicycles (mechanical and electrically assisted), the users (which may posses a reg-
istration card), the maintenance crew (responsible for collecting/replacing broken down
bicycles), etc. Based on the systems requirements you are required to develop a 
Java framework, hereafter called myVelib, for managing bike sharing.
